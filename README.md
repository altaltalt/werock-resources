# Apps
Apps can be so #useful and #fun. Here are a few recommendations on ones that you might find useful.

**Autochords**
Search in the App Store for it, but here's the link. https://autochords.com/ . It's a chord generator that tells you how to play progressions that sound happy, grungy, cliche, hopeful, melancholic, and one called "Sad Dennis" (no, I'm not making this up) in any key!

**Ultimate Guitar**
This is the gold standard. Every guitarist has this app. It has various version you can buy. Some come with a metronome or interactive tabs. Personally, I like the full version, which is about $10-20, because it has a tuner and interactive tabs. If you want to find out if you like interactive tabs, try going to http://songsterr.com/ and checking a few out.

# Fun Stuff

**She Shreds Magazine.**
She Shreds Magazine is the world’s only print + web publication dedicated to women guitarists and bassists. They have a ton of great tutorials, interviews with musicians, and reviews of gear. They also accept pitches, so if you enjoy writing, reach out to them! Check them out: http://sheshredsmag.com/

# The Youtubes 

**Justin**
So, the person who is considered the default guru is Justin, from Justin Guitar. He has decent lessons from start to finish: http://www.justinguitar.com/. I like some of his stuff, but find the acoustic guitar a bit tedious to listen to. However, he has great explanations for more challenging concepts! 

Here's his beginner courses all in order: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1PRD0kMgI8&list=PLCAAA4629624F20D8 

**Mahalo**
Mahalo was a website that's now defunct but used to have pretty rad guitar tutorials. They cover a lot of pop artists, but there's some funky bit in there too.

Find all their tutorials here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5CFB82966A2B6CDB


**Nerdy more advanced stuff**
Signals audio has a channel full of ridiculous though informative videos, which cover how to play things in a spooky fashion and how to tell what intervals you're hearing. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRDDHLvQb8HjE2r7_ZuNtWA/videos


# Playing Bruno Mars
This is for a particular student who we all think is great.
